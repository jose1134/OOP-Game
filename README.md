# OOP-Game
This is the 4th Project from Team Tree House's Tech Degree program.

Some of the additions i have added were a hover color 

when a user hovers over the key he would like the choose the key would highlight a dark gray,
showing the user which key they are about to choose.

I have changed the title font to a fot that i feel looks nice with the layout of the project 

I have also changed the key color, so when the user chooses a wrong or right option, they either get red for 'wrong' or green for 'right'

Also changed the background of the start page, because i felt that the default blue, is dull and does not pop out, in my opinion.
